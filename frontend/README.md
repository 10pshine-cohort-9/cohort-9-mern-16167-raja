# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Linting

This project is pre-configured with ESLint for code quality. Currently, the linting scope is explicitly configured to analyze JavaScript and JSX files (`**/*.{js,jsx}`). To lint TypeScript files (`.ts`, `.tsx`), you must extend the `eslint.config.js` with TypeScript ESLint support. Run the current linter using:
`npm run lint`
